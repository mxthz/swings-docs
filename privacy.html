        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Your Privacy Matters:</strong> Swings is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your mood data stays on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Data You Provide</h3>
        <p>Swings stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mood Entries:</strong> Your daily mood selections (amazing, good, neutral, bad, awful)</li>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Text notes you add about what went well or poorly each day</li>
            <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Calendar dates associated with your mood entries</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> Information about your premium subscription (if applicable)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <p>We want to be clear about what we don't collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do NOT collect your mood entries or notes on our servers</li>
            <li>We do NOT track your location</li>
            <li>We do NOT access your contacts or photos</li>
            <li>We do NOT share your personal information with third parties</li>
            <li>We do NOT use analytics or tracking services</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        
        <h3>Local Storage Only</h3>
        <p>All your mood data is stored locally on your device using encrypted storage. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data never leaves your device</li>
            <li>We cannot access your mood entries or notes</li>
            <li>Your data is protected by iOS security measures</li>
            <li>If you delete the app, all your data is permanently deleted</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Subscription Information</h3>
        <p>When you purchase a subscription through the App Store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple processes the payment (we never see your payment information)</li>
            <li>Apple provides us with a receipt to verify your subscription status</li>
            <li>We store subscription status locally to unlock premium features</li>
            <li>You can restore purchases on other devices you own</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        
        <h3>Encryption</h3>
        <p>Your mood data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption (SQLCipher) when stored on your device. This provides an additional layer of security beyond iOS's built-in protections.</p>
        
        <h3>iOS Security</h3>
        <p>Swings leverages iOS's sandboxing technology, which means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is isolated from other apps</li>
            <li>Other apps cannot access your Swings data</li>
            <li>Data is protected by your device passcode/biometric authentication</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Backup and Sync</h2>
        
        <h3>iCloud Backup</h3>
        <p>If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your Swings data may be included in your device's encrypted backup. This is controlled by your iOS settings, not by the app.</p>
        
        <h3>No Cloud Sync</h3>
        <p>Currently, Swings does not offer cloud synchronization between devices. Each device maintains its own local database.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can access all your data within the app at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete individual mood entries or all data by deleting the app</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Future versions may include data export capabilities</li>
            <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You don't need to create an account to use Swings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>Swings is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since all data is stored locally and we don't collect personal information, there is no data transmitted that could identify users of any age.</p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <h3>Apple App Store</h3>
        <p>When you purchase a subscription, you are subject to Apple's privacy policy regarding in-app purchases. Apple processes payments and provides subscription receipts to verify your purchase status.</p>
        
        <h3>No Other Third Parties</h3>
        <p>Swings does not integrate with any other third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
            <li>Providing notice within the app if changes are material</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how Swings handles your data, please contact us through the App Store.</p>
